This is a peer-to-peer AI hedge fund platform enabling collaborative investment strategies through decentralized technologies.

⸻

✅ What the concept involves

• Investors (peers) pooling capital and approving selected strategies directly, rather than going through a traditional centralized hedge fund.
• Use of artificial intelligence / machine-learning to generate investment strategies or signals.
• A decentralized architecture so that the strategy rollout, capital allocation, performance-fees etc can be automated/transparently executed without intermediaries.
• Transparent, trustless mechanisms for strategy deployment and investor access.

⚙️ How it works

• Algorithmic/AI strategy developers offer trading/investment strategies.
• Investors pick or allocate capital across these strategies, often via tokenised vaults.
• Peer-to-peer execution handles deposits, strategy execution/tracking/performance fees, profit distribution in a transparent way.
• Intrasystem governance allows investors to vote on strategy approvals, fee structures, and other key decisions.
• Lending and leveraging among peers to amplify returns.
• The system reduces reliance on traditional fund managers, centralised intermediaries, and introduces collaborative/crowd-sourced strategy creation and capital allocation.
